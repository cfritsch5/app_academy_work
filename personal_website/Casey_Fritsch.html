<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>If the saying goes the more you know the more you realize how much you don't know, then I want to know enough to have some incling of how little I know in both knowledge and human experience. I would like to use my intelligence, technical expertise, and problem solving skills to undermine the great injustices of society, and I have been described as articulate, highly organized, an excellent listener, and a humanitarian. I act to leave a legacy of kindness that resonates past my own influence and makes the world a better place. </p>
<!--
, an excellent comunicator skilled at listening and clearly articulating my own points, highly organized, and with a keen aptitude for well thought out implementation.

  <p> I am using free online resourses like Duolingo and LearnSpanish, and have committed to practing every day. I am focusing on Spanish because it is both a widely used language nationally and internationally, and is fairly accesable from english. One of my life goals is to learn another language fluently and spend at least a year living in a country that uses it as the main language. I believe that this would be great experience to learn and appreciate how little I know of how people live around the world, from small nuances to vast gulfs of cultural communication or resources.

  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/5276066"><img id="grchallenge" src="./Casey_Fritsch_files/images/GoodReadsChallenge2016Complete.PNG"></a>
  <p> I participated in the 2016 GoodReads Reading Challenge to encourage myself to read and grow. I love reading, not only to learn factual information, but to also grow as a person and stand in the shoes of others. In January I set my goal for 32 books, and intentionally read books from diverse perspectives. I surpased my original goal and was able to complete 37 books. My goal for 2017 is to increase my reading goal from 32 to 52, a rate of one book a week, and write a short review of each one to give back into a system I benefit from as well as help me understand and remember the content. </p>

  <h5><em>Creating tools for myself and others</em></h5>
  <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/CFritsch5"><img id="cc" src="./Casey_Fritsch_files/images/codecademyCourses.PNG"></a>
  <p>Software is one of the most flexible tools we have ever created and programming and software engineering are necesssary and fun skills going forward. I had taken some formal classes on programming in college, Java I &amp; II, and Computer Science for Engineers (MatLab), and returned to TA Comp. Sci. for Eng. However a year after graduating I remembered the concepts but I was rusty on specifics. I want to have sufficient depth of knowledge that I am able to create a standalone program or app. I have used Codecademy to both practice the language I already know, and to learn new ones. I have taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS in order to build this website, and am making headway with JavaScript. </p>

  <h4>The Human Library</h4>

  <p> The Human Library is a project that aims to start conversations in the
    community to better understand the other side of stereotypes,
    discrimination, and bias. Each event gathers readers, general members of
    the community, and books, people in the communtiy who have a life experience
    or identity that is misunderstood in our society, to have respectful and
    open conversations. I volunteered independantly in March, and created a
    partnership between The Human Library Chicago and The Residence and Greek
    Life office at Illinois Institute of Technology to set up the collaborative
    event on campus in April. I participated as a book in both the March and
    April 2015 events talking about my expeirience being transgender.</p>

    <p>City Year is an Americorps program that aims to address the drop out crisis  in our nations most underserved schools.   Americorps volunteers work full time as mentors and tutors to support students learning and growth. I proudly served with City Year Sacramento for the 2015-2016 year in a 9th grade Algebra 1 classroom.</p>

<h4>Road Trip</h4>
<div class="projects" id="roadtrip">
 <p>We call america the great for a good reason; its huge. How much of america have any of us actually seen? How can we negotiate a future together if we really don't have a visceral understanding of the scope involved? </p>
  <p>With that in mind I set out in the Summer of 2016 on a ten day road trip and drove from California all the way back east.
  I dropped in San Franscisco before I drove up the coast stoppiong to see the great redwoods, sea lions and seals along the way.
  Up to Portland, Oregon and the waterfalls of the Cascadian Mountains. Then on to Seattle Washington where I saw the Original Starbucks at Pike Place Market.
  From the Pacific Northwest I started the long stretch east accross the dry interior of Washington State, the steep mountain passes in the pan handle of Idaho, and the widening sky out into Montana.
  I headed slightly south and spent some time exploring the gesers and wild beauty of Yellowstone National Park before crossing the wide open expanses of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Iowa. Heading into home territory, I then picked up the pace and drove over 18 hours from Iowa to my destination in eastern Pennsylvania. </p>
