      <p> The Human Library is a project that aims to start conversations in the
        community to better understand the other side of stereotypes,
        discrimination, and bias. Each event gathers readers, general members of
        the community, and books, people in the communtiy who have a life experience
        or identity that is misunderstood in our society, to have respectful and
        open conversations. I volunteered independantly in March, and created a
        partnership between The Human Library Chicago and The Residence and Greek
        Life office at Illinois Institute of Technology to set up the collaborative
        event on campus in April. I participated as a book in both the March and
        April 2015 events talking about my expeirience being transgender.</p>
